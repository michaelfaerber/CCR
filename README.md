# Claim-based Citation Recommendation

Citation recommendation refers to the task of recommending appropriate citations for a text passage within a document. Although dozens of approaches to citation recommendation have been proposed, they actually do not consider the semantics of the claims to be backed up. In this proposed shared task, we propose the task which given an input claim consists of finding the text passages in other documents that match with the input claim. We will provide a novel dataset consisting of scientific publications' fulltexts. The task and the approaches to be developed will pave the way toward a new generation of citation recommendation, and will promote research concerning natural language processing (e.g., claim extraction), knowledge representation (e.g., claim-centric knowledge graphs), and machine learning.
